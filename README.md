## Overview

**Smart Class** is a comprehensive Full-Stack IoT ecosystem designed to monitor, analyze, and optimize energy consumption in educational environments.

The system solves the problem of energy waste (lights/AC left on) by providing real-time monitoring through distributed sensors, a centralized server for data processing, and multi-platform client applications.

### Key Features
* **Real-time Monitoring:** Tracks Temperature, Light levels, and Motion.
* **Cross-Platform Mobile App:** Built with Flutter (Android/iOS).
* **Web Dashboard:** User-friendly interface for quick status checks.
* **Data Analytics:** Specialized Streamlit dashboard for historical data analysis.
* **Scalable Architecture:** Dockerized backend ensuring easy deployment on Raspberry Pi or Cloud.

## System Architecture

The project is divided into three main layers:

1.  **Hardware Layer (Edge):**
    * **Device:** Wemos D1 Mini (ESP8266).
    * **Sensors:** DHT11 (Temperature), PIR (Motion), LDR (Light).
    * **Protocol:** HTTP/JSON over Wi-Fi.

2.  **Server Layer (Backend):**
    * **Tech Stack:** Python, Flask, SQLite.
    * **Deployment:** Docker & Docker Compose.
    * **Services:** REST API + Web Dashboard + Streamlit App.

3.  **Client Layer (Frontend):**
    * **Mobile:** Flutter App for remote monitoring.
    * **Web:** HTML/JS Dashboard & Streamlit Analytics.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Docker Desktop installed.

Arduino IDE for flashing firmware.

Flutter SDK (optional, to run the mobile app).

1. Run the Server (Backend)
The easiest way to start the system is using Docker. It will launch both the Flask API and the Analytics App.

Bash

cd server
docker-compose up --build
Once running, access the dashboards:

Web Monitor: http://localhost:5000

Analytics Dashboard: http://localhost:8501

2. Setup Hardware (Firmware)
Open firmware/main.ino in Arduino IDE.

Install the DHT sensor library via Library Manager.

Update the configuration:

C++

const char* ssid = "YOUR_WIFI_NAME";
const char* password = "YOUR_WIFI_PASS";
const char* serverUrl = "http://YOUR_PC_IP:5000/api/data";
Flash the code to Wemos D1 Mini.

3. Run Mobile App
Navigate to the app folder:

Bash

cd mobile_app
Update SERVER_IP in lib/main.dart to match your PC's IP.

Run on emulator or device:

Bash

flutter pub get
flutter run
Gallery

Web Dashboard & Analytics
Mobile Application
Future Improvements
[ ] Implement Machine Learning model for energy usage prediction.

[ ] Add MQTT support for lower latency.

[ ] Add Authentication/Login system.
